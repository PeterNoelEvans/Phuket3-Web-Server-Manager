# Phuket3-Web-Server-Manager
This allows soft-coding wifi credentials to set up a hotspot on an ESP32
how to use Wi-Fi Manager with the ESP32 using MicroPython firmware. Wi-Fi Manager allows you to connect your ESP32 to different Access Points (different networks) without having to hard-code your credentials and upload new code to your board.
The ESP32 will set up an Access Point that you can use to configure the network credentials, or it will automatically join to a known saved network.
